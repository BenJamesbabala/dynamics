% A key requirement for [flexible, scalable, generalization] intellgience is: Ground learning intuitive theories of physics and psychology, to support and enrich the knowledge that is learned (according to Lake et al)
%   - well this comment can be in the disucssion because my model is attempting to ground things in intuitive theories of physics, and that this can ``support'' and ``enrich'' knowledge that has been learned because it is a simulator and can be used as a primitive in a higher level system.

% Simulator as a causal model can be used to plan action sequences, predict what will happen, imagine what would happen. Random thought: simulation/imagination can be used as a mechanism for you to decide "where you are" in the temporal hierarchy and thus would be useful in learning-to-learn
