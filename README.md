# [Neural Physics Engine](http://mbchang.github.io/npe)

[Project Website](http://mbchang.github.io/npe)

We present the Neural Physics Engine (NPE), an object-based neural network
architecture for learning predictive models of intuitive physics. We propose a
factorization of a physical scene into composable object-based representations
and also the NPE architecture whose compositional structure factorizes object
dynamics into pairwise interactions. Our approach draws on the strengths of
both symbolic and neural approaches: like a symbolic physics engine, the NPE is
endowed with generic notions of objects and their interactions, but as a neural
network it can also be trained via stochastic gradient descent to adapt to
specific object properties and dynamics of different worlds. We evaluate the
efficacy of our approach on simple rigid body dynamics in two-dimensional
worlds. By comparing to less structured architectures, we show that our model's
compositional representation of the structure in physical interactions improves
its ability to predict movement, generalize to different numbers of objects,
and infer latent properties of objects such as mass.

Below are some predictions from the model:

## Instructions
_The instructions below are missing some details._

Pretrained network and dataset can be downloaded at: COMING SOON. 

### Generating Data

The code to generate data is adapted from the demo code in
[matter-js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js).

This is an example of generating 50000 trajectories of 4 balls of variable mass over 60 timesteps. It will create a folder `balls_n4_t60_s50000_m` in the `data/` folder. 
```shell
> cd src/js
> node demo/js/generate.js -e balls -n 4 -t 60 -s 50000 -m
```
This is an example of generating 50000 trajectories of 2 balls over 60 timesteps for wall geometry "U." It will create a folder `walls_n2_t60_s50000_wU` in the `data/` folder.
```shell
> cd src/js
> node demo/js/Demo.js -e walls -n 2 -t 60 -s 50000 -w U
```

If you prefer, a script (`src/js/mj_runner.py`)  (not cleaned up yet) has been provided to make these commands more convenient.


### Training the Model
This is an example of training the model for the `balls_n4_t60_s50000_m` dataset. `bffobj` corresponds to the NPE. The model checkpoints are saved in `src/lua/logs/balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m_rda__balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m_rda_layers5_nbrhd_rs_fast_nlan_lr0.0003_modelnp_seed0`. If you are comfortable looking at code that has not been cleaned up yet, please check out the flags in `src/lua/main.lua`. 
```shell
> cd src/lua
> th main.lua -layers 5 -dataset_folders "{'balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m_rda'}" -nbrhd -rs -test_dataset_folders "{'balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m_rda'}" -fast -nlan -lr 0.0003 -model bffobj -seed 0 -name balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m_rda__balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m_rda_layers5_nbrhd_rs_fast_nlan_lr0.0003_modelnp_seed0 -mode exp
```

Here is an example of training on 3, 4, 5 balls of variable mass and testing on 6, 7, 8 balls of variable mass, provided that those datasets have been generated.
```shell
> cd src/lua
> th main.lua -layers 5 -dataset_folders "{'balls_n3_t60_ex50000_m_rda','balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m_rda','balls_n5_t60_ex50000_m_rda'}" -nbrhd -rs -test_dataset_folders "{'balls_n6_t60_ex50000_m_rda','balls_n7_t60_ex50000_m_rda','balls_n8_t60_ex50000_m_rda'}" -fast -nlan -lr 0.0003 -model bffobj -seed 0 -name balls_n3_t60_ex50000_m_rda,balls_n4_t60_ex50000_m_rda,balls_n5_t60_ex50000_m_rda__balls_n6_t60_ex50000_m_rda,balls_n7_t60_ex50000_m_rda,balls_n8_t60_ex50000_m_rda_layers5_nbrhd_rs_fast_nlan_lr0.0003_modelbffobj_seed0 -mode exp
```

Here is an example of training on "O" and "I" wall geometries and testing on "U" and "I" wall geometries, provided that those datasets have been generated.
```shell
> cd src/lua
> th main.lua -layers 5 -dataset_folders "{'walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wO_rda','walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wL_rda'}" -nbrhd -rs -test_dataset_folders "{'walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wU_rda','walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wI_rda'}" -fast -nlan -lr 0.0003 -model bffobj -seed 0 -name walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wO_rda,walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wL_rda__walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wU_rda,walls_n2_t60_ex50000_wI_rda_layers5_nbrhd_rs_fast_nlan_lr0.0003_modelbffobj_seed0 -mode exp 
```

If you prefer, a script (`src/lua/runner_mj.py`)  (not cleaned up yet) has been provided to make these commands more convenient.
